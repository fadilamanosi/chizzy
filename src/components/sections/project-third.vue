                        Staking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software. A validator stores data,
                        processes transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain. Liquid staking (also known as soft
                        staking) allows stakers deposit any amount of ETH by joining forces with other stakers. Unlike
                        proof-of-stake staking (PoS) that locks fund in the protocol, stakers receive liquid staking
                        derivatives in exchange for their staked assets.

                        Stakify is a staking protocol built to contribute to the security of ethereum and to support its
                        decentralization. It is a liquid staking solution that solves the problem of locked liquidity by
                        providing instant liquidity for staked assets. It lowers the staking barrier by allowing stakers
                        stake any amount of ETH.

                        After the merge, ethereum now consisted of two chains, the beacon chain and the consensus layer.

                                Depositing 32 ETH to activate a validator node is not very feasible for a lot of users. Some
                                users want to stake as little as 0.1 ETH and other have more than 32 ETH, a staking protocol
                                with pooling functionality like Stakify was built to address this problem by allowing users
                                stake any amount of ETH which is then pooled together with the stake of other users to
                                activate a validator.

                            easy to achieve coherence with the brand identity and the UI design. I went for cool colours and
